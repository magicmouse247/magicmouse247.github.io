			<h1>Releases</h1> <!-- the "h1" tag is for a top-level header -->
			<p>Montreal-based band The Painters share Rain, a new two-song release available now. The tracks are the
				first to be released from a body of work that was recorded when the band found themselves quarantined
				together in their shared home studio after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. As other facets of their
				lives were swiftly brought to a halt, the group, fronted by singer-songwriter Alex Bourque, took refuge
				in the shared experience of creation while rehearsing for off-the-floor recording sessions and
				experimenting with new recording approaches.</p> <!-- the "p" tag is for text -->
			<h2>Blog</h2> <!-- the "h2" tag is for a second-level header -->
			<p>Knowing that the world was thirsty for new media after months of lockdown, the group sought to release
				music as soon as possible, without having to jump through the usual hoops, and wait times of the music
				industry. Drawing on their experience as co-founders of DIY label Egg Paper Factory, the band opted to
				release these new singles on the newly-minted Gas Money Records, a boutique label spearheaded by
				producer and band member Josh Boguski. </p>
